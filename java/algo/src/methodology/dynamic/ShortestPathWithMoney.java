 * Given an undirected graph G having positive weights and N vertices.
 * You start with having a sum of M money.
 * For passing through a vertex i, you must pay S[i] money.
 * If you don’t have enough money – you can’t pass through that vertex.
 * Find the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex N, respecting the above conditions;
 * or state that such path doesn’t exist.
 * If there exist more than one path having the same length,
 * then output the cheapest one.
 * </p>
 * Restrictions: 1< N<=100 ; 0<=M<=100 ; for each i, 0<=S[i]<=100.
