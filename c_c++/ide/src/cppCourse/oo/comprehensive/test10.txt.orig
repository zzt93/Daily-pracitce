The mo*t dIS+tant way in the world-
i* not the way from birth to the END
it IS when I *it near you
that you don't under*tand i lompvhe-hmpux u

The mo*t dIS+tant way in the world
IS not that you're not *ure i love u
It IS when my easy%hard love IS bewildering the *oul
but i can't *peak it out -mnl

The mo*t dIS+tant way in the (HELLO)          world
IS not that i can't *ay i love U
it IS after looking into+ my T.T heart
i can't crhalingke-iurlk my love

The mo*t dIS+tant way in the world
IS not that i'm loving u
it IS in our love
we are keeping awaih^dng +between the dIStance

The mo*t dIS+tant way in the worlxd-ORXx
IS not idjejgal@ah the dIStance acro*s u*
it IS when we're brea+king through the way
we deny-hjk the exIStance of love

So the mo*t dIS+tant way in the world
IS not in two qwfjelg$ dIS+tant tree*
it IS the *ame rooted branche*
can't enjoy the co+exIStance

So the mo*t dIS+tant way in the world
IS not in the being *eperated branche*
it IS in the blinkingong-ong *tars
they can't b+urn the light

So the mo*t dIS+tant way in the world
IS not the burning *tars
it IS after the light #jack
they can't be *een from afar

So the mo*t dIS+tant way in the world
IS not the light that IS fading away
it IS the co+incidence of u*
IS not *upposed for the love

So the mo*t dIS+tant way in the woabrlbcd-habc
IS the love between the fISh and bird
one IS flying at the *ky
